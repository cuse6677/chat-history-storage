    "text": "The use of makeup kits typically involves applying various cosmetic products such as foundation, blush, eyeshadow, mascara, and lipstick to enhance or alter one's appearance. Each product in a makeup kit has specific instructions for application, which usually include using brushes, sponges, or applicators to apply the product evenly on the skin.\n\nSide effects of makeup kits can vary depending on the ingredients and individual skin sensitivities. Common side effects may include:\n\n1. **Allergic reactions**: Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to certain ingredients in makeup products, leading to redness, itching, or swelling. If an allergic reaction occurs, it is advised to stop using the product immediately and consult with a dermatologist if necessary [1].\n\n2. **Skin irritation**: Makeup products can sometimes cause skin irritation, especially if they are not suitable for one's skin type. For example, a cleanser in the kit might dry out the skin, in which case using a hydrating toner and moisturizer afterward is recommended [2].\n\n3. **Breakouts**: Some makeup products can clog pores and lead to acne breakouts, particularly if they are not removed properly at the end of the day. Using a suitable makeup remover and following a proper skincare routine can help mitigate this issue [2].\n\n4. **Texture changes**: Exposure to air or moisture can alter the texture of some makeup products, making them less effective or harder to apply. Ensuring that containers are closed tightly after each use can help prevent this [2].\n\n5. **Eye irritation**: Products like mascara or eyeshadow can sometimes cause eye irritation, especially if they are not applied carefully or if they contain certain ingredients that are not well-tolerated by the user. Using high-quality brushes and avoiding pumping the mascara wand can help reduce this risk [3]â€‹[2].\n\nIt is important to read the ingredient list and follow the usage instructions provided with the makeup kit to minimize the risk of side effects. If any adverse reactions occur, it is advisable to discontinue use and seek professional advice.\n\n[1]: cite:1 \"Citation-1\"\n[2]: cite:2 \"Citation-2\"\n[3]: cite:3 \"Citation-3\"",
